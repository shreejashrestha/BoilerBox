# BoilerBox

An android application written with Flutter to interact with the BoilerBox ECE 477 senior design project.

## Features

This application allows users to:
  1. connect with their BoilerBox device through Bluetooth
  2. sign in to their Spotify account (and authenticate)
  3. pause/play/skip songs currently playing on Spotify
  4. play multiple different LEDs 'shows'
  5. choose 'Music Mode' to play the LEDs based on your playing songs!
  
Behind the scenes, the app connects to a server that runs the machine learning algorithm to classify the mood of the song.
